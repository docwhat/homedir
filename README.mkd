That's it!

## The Story So Farâ€¦

Since about 1999 I've been keeping my home directory config files in
[CVS](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/). As the number of config files I've
been storing has grown and as the number of different systems I use it
on (my work desktop, my home desktop, my laptop, Gerf, my pda)
increases. As the complexity has grown it has become harder to
maintain.

So, I started looking around for a better solution. I noticed that
[SVN](http://subversion.tigris.org/) is a much better version control
system. I was already familiar with
[stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html) as well. So I
tinkered around with combining them.

And thus homedir was born!

Since then, I rewrote HomeDir completely in python. This gives me more
control over the help and error messages. I can do better when
conflicts arrive. As well as I can add an elementry package format,
which allows me to solve the problem that uninstalling a stow package
can take forever if you have a lot of directories in your home.

A [friend](http://willnorris.com/) pointed out that the most important
part was the package manager.  The various .dotfiles are interesting
to look at, but most people have their own.  So I moved just the
package manager portion to [github](http://github.com/)

## Migrating from older versions of homedir

### 2.x

I'm working on the migration stuff.

### 1.x

If you've using the pre-2.0 version of HomeDir (hosted on trac.gerf.org) then you should back up your .homedir directory before running the above `setup.py` script.

The main change is that everything in `~/.homedir/files` has been moved to `~/.homedir/packages` and the packages will no longer be automatically updated.

## Change Log

## 3.x

  * Rewrite in Ruby
  * Tons of unit tests

## 2.x

  * Broke out the code to be easier to debug and work with.
  * Started adding tests.
  * Suggestions on package management from Will Norris.

## 1.x

The original HomeDir, which was hosted on trac.gerf.org, is going to be considered version 1.

Version 1 had a configuration file that kept track of where your packages were located.

In this new version packages can be placed anyplace under the directory
`~/.homedir/packages` (except inside another package, of course).

This allows for more flexability for managing packages.

This also means that sync/synccmd is no longer supported.

## Similar Ideas

* I have also noticed that [Joey Hess](http://www.kitenet.net/~joey) has
also done something similar and written two articles about it:
  * [CVS homedir, or keeping your life in CVS](http://kitenet.net/~joey/cvshome.html)
  * [Subversion Users: home directory in svn?](http://www.kitenet.net/~joey/svnhome.html)
* [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) does a lot of similar things, but for the system.
* The software package 'stow' also does similar symlinking for package installation. The original algorithm for directories was taken from there.
